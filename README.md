## Introduction

DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression. This repository provides R scripts for the analysis of DNA methylation data generated from the **Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC** and **Infinium Mouse Methylation** methylation arrays.

## Content

### Human EPIC Array Methylation Data

The `human_epic_analysis.R` script is designed to analyze DNA methylation data from the HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip array.

### Mouse Methylation Array Data

The `mouse_analysis.R` script is tailored for the analysis of DNA methylation data from mouse methylation array experiments.

## Annotation Files

This repository includes annotation files specifically created for mouse data. These files provide additional information about genomic features and facilitate the interpretation of methylation data. Find these files in the `annotation_files` directory.
